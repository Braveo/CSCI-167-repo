# CSCI 167 - INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING

Github repo for CSCI 167 at CSU Fresno.

## SETUP

Virtual environment not included, but the version I've been using for this is Python 3.12.1 with these terminal commands (in Windows):

```
> python -m venv .venv
> .venv/Scripts/activate
> pip install numpy
> pip install matplotlib
```

And from there, you should be done! I also use vscode as the text editor for Jupyter notebooks. 

Sorry for working on this in the middle of class, Dr. Ruby.
